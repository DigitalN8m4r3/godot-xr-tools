## XR Tools Interactable Handle script
##
## The interactable handle is a (usually invisible) object extending from
## [XRToolsPickable] that can be grabbed by the player and is used to
## manipulate interactable objects.
##
## The interactible handle has an origin position of its parent. In order
## to position interactible handles on the interactible object, the handle
## should be placed under a parent handle-origin node, and the origin nodes
## position set as desired.
##
## When the handle is released, it snaps back to its parent origin. If the
## handle is pulled further than its snap distance, then the handle is
## automatically released.


## Distance from the handle origin to auto-snap the grab
@export var snap_distance : float = 0.3

@export_group("Optional attach Hand")
## this latches the grabbing Hand onto the Interactable

# Additional Note: if export paths are not set, this will be ignored
# so make sure to setup the paths corresponding to hand
# Example: left_hand_position = LeftHandMarker3D
## Requirement: Collision Hands
@export var left_hand_position : Marker3D
